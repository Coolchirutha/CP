# My Journal for Competitive Programming in C++

This is a collection of my code which i have learnt and written during my journey towards Competitive Programming in C++. I have started working with [A2OJ ladder](https://a2oj.com/Ladders.html) where I have worked on the first ladder for a rating below 1300 in [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/).

After working out the basics and getting familiar with the basics of competitive programming, I have moved on to the Step2 Folder where I worked on problems from [Leetcode](www.leetcode.com).

All the question numbers are written and some tricky questions I have explained my approach to the problem and also explained the code. In some problems you may find multiple approaches to the same problem.

This repository is to help others as well as for myself when i need to revise some topics or questions in my future. I will try to keep this as updated as possible.
